# 🩸 Blood Donation Prediction – Classification Project

This project focuses on predicting whether a donor is likely to donate blood in the near future based on historical donation patterns. Using **binary classification models**, the goal is to assist blood banks and NGOs in targeting the right donors for efficient outreach and blood supply planning.

> ✅ The dataset was processed from structured tabular data containing past donation behaviors and intervals.

## 🧪 Problem Statement

Effective donor prediction can significantly reduce shortages and overstock in blood banks. By analyzing historical donation data, this project builds a model to predict the likelihood of a donor returning for future donations.
